	<p>Ocean's 6 created different maps to find eddies and contoured map and diagrams. They also created an algorithm that identifies eddies. This group got their data from Copernicus marine. They didn't have to clean their data because it was already arranged in a Numpy array. Also created data visualizations. </p>
