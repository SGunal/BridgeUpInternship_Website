  <h1>ConsRvation</h1>
	<p>This group was focusing on how much the land has changed over the years. Their goal was to use machine learning to map different types of land in the Solomon Islands. They had to find forest covering of Solomon islands. They also wanted to find out over the years how much has the land changed and if it was changing over time. Their data is a CSV file, it's a Raster data, it comes from satellites (numbers) about light. It is Satellite images of Solomon Islands. Throughput their process they explored data, learned different functions, checked how much data they had and what is in it. They also had to get rid of na(Not available) and fill in missing. They also did data visualization(plots).</p>
	<h3>Languages & Libraries used:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The language used was R.</li>
	<li>Libraries used were Raster and rgdal.</li>
</ul>
	 <h3>Challenges:</h3>
	 <ul>
	 	<li>A challenge was when plotting.</li>
	 	<li>Assigning rgb to different band layers.</li>
	 	<li>Set the working directory.</li>
	 	<li>They found difficult the layers of satellite data that correspond to different types of light.</li>
	 </ul>
