	<p>This group was focusing on how much the land has changed over the years. Their goal was to use machine learning to map different types of land in the Solomon Islands. They had to find forest covering of the Solomon islands. They also wanted to find out over the years how much the land has changed and if it was changing over time. Their data came in a CSV file; Raster data, which comes from satellites (numbers) about light. Basically it was Satellite images of the Solomon Islands. Throughout their process they explored data, learned different functions, checked how much data they had and what was in it. They also had to get rid of NA values (Not available) and fill in missing values. Finaly, they also did data visualization (plots).</p>

<h3>Some challenges they encountered:</h3>
	 <ul>
	 	<li>A challenge was when plotting.</li>
	 	<li>Assigning rgb to different band layers.</li>
	 	<li>Set the working directory.</li>
	 	<li>They found difficult the layers of satellite data that correspond to different types of light.</li>
