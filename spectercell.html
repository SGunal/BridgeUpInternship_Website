	<h1>Specter Cell</h1>
	<p>	This group has been learning and finding new information about brown dwarfs, an object in space that's bigger than a planet and smaller than a star. Theyâ€™ve been working with specific data, which they got from the Gaia satellite, to find brown dwarfs. They added the data from Gaia into the BDNYC database, a huge database of brown dwarfs. Then, they  cross-referenced the BDNYC database with the Gaia data to find new brown dwarfs. This may have caused some overlaps so they had to clean their data. Also, people catalog brown dwarves differently, so they had to clean that as well. The way they did it was by using coordinates in space instead of names, because the name can differ depending on the database. That was a challenge they initially encountered. Their goal is to use Open Space to make a presentation about brown dwarfs in the AMNH planetarium. They completed this project by using two different languages; they also used different functions and some libraries.</p>
<h3>Languages & Libraries used:</h3>
<ul>
  	<li>The two languages they used are Python and SQL.</li>
  	<li>Libraries in python that they used were Pandas, matplotlib, and astrodb.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Challenges:</h3>
 <ul>
 	<li>Learning a new language (SQL) using Khan Academy.</li>
 	<li>Coming across errors.</li>
 	<li>Not understanding the code.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Problem Solving:</h3>
 <ul>
 	<li>Add things or take away things.</li>
 	<li>Reach out to your peers.</li>
 	<li>Step back from the code to clear your mind and come back fresh-minded.</li>
 </ul>

  <h3>Final results/Graphs:</h3>
