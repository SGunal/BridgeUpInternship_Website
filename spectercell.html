    <h3>Discovering Phantom Worlds: Completing and Visualizing the BDNYC Database </h3>

    <p>The students who selected this project were exposed to tiered learning split between database ingestion and cleaning as well as data visualization. Students began with an introduction to the SQL database that houses the world’s largest collection of brown dwarf observable information. The first level of skill sets included learning to create template scripts in Python and SQL to ingest new data into the BDNYC database. The second level of skills applied higher level python code to clean the database from duplicate entries and missing fields, as well as account for more precise measurement acquisitions. The third level of skill sets take advantage of visualization software “Partiview” and “OpenSpace”, which is housed and developed at AMNH. Students incorporated the entirety of their data into Partiview and OpenSpace to create interactive 3-D movies. In order to complete this step, students were invited into the Hayden Planetarium and trained on the dome hardware.</p>
