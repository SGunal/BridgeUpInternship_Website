	<p>	This group has been learning and finding new information about brown dwarfs, an object in space that's bigger than a planet and smaller than a star. Theyâ€™ve been working with specific data that comes from the GAIA satellite about brown dwarfs. They added the data from GAIA into the BDNYC database, a huge database of brown dwarfs. Then, they  cross-referenced the BDNYC database with the GAIA data to find new brown dwarfs. This may have caused some overlaps so they had to clean their data. Also, people catalog brown dwarves differently, so they had to clean that as well. The way they did it was by using coordinates in space instead of names because names can differ depending on the database. That was a challenge they initially encountered. Their final goal was to use Open Space to make a presentation about brown dwarfs in the AMNH planetarium. They completed this project by using two different programming languages; they also used different functions and some libraries.</p>
