  <h3>Who we are</h3>
    <h4>Six teenage girls who wanted to create a website!</h4>
    <p>Hi there, welcome to our website. Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. So..who are we. Well we're titanic(float)none (A python joke you will come to understand one day. We're a group of Brown Scholar interns at the American Museum of Natural History who are looking to teach teenagers, like ourselves, about data science.</p>
    <H3>Our Team</H3>

  <h3>Our Mission/Goals</h3>
    <h4>1. To make data science more inclusive</h4>
    	<p> From web development to user experience design the technological world is not where it needs to be in terms of inclusiveness and diversity. 35.3 percent of female students take data science courses compared to 62.8 percant of male students. Also people of minority groups are the lowest percentage of students who enroll in data science courses. We hope by creating this website users who are underrepresneted in the field of data science can learn more about data science and see what data science can do for them. This will hopfully inspire individuals to study the field more extensively to close those gaps. </p>
    <h4>2. To make data science less intimidating</h4>
    	<p>Contrary to popular belief data science is very simple. It's very much like how when we come across somthing new, we explore it. Data science is similar to that, but you are just doing that "exploring" in the computer. By using this website you will notice that data science can be applied to any thing that has data. Data science is a just a new way to learn about the world. It's more universal then people believe it to be. It's a new way to do something we have always done. It's a new way to explore the data around you.</p>
    <h4>3. To familiarize data science to high school students</h4>
