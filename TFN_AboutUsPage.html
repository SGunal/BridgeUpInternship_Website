	<h3>A Message To You</h3>

	<p>
		Hi there, welcome to our website! Thank you for taking the time to learn about us.<br><br>So...who are we? Well, we're .titanic{float:none;} (A CSS joke that we learned while making this website).<br><br>We're a group of Brown Scholars interns at the American Museum of Natural History who are looking to teach teenagers, like ourselves, about data science.

    <h3>Why Data Science?</h3>

    <h4>Data Science + Scientific Research = Computational Science</h4>

    <p>Launched in 2014, BridgeUP: STEM is an ambitious initiative designed to bridge the gender and opportunity gaps in computational science for girls and young women. With the generous support of the Helen Gurley Brown Revocable Trust, BridgeUP: STEM @ AMNH has developed a distinct identity in the landscape of computer science education by embedding programming in the context of scientific research and communication to support participants’ college and career outcomes. The Brown Scholars component provides an introduction to computer programming, data science and visualization, and scientific research to high school girls.

    <h3>Missions and Goals:</h3>
    <h4>Make data science more inclusive</h4>
    <p> From web development to user experience design the technological world is not where it needs to be in terms of inclusiveness and diversity. Only 35.3% of female students take data science courses compared to 62.8% of male students. Also, people of minority groups are the lowest percentage of students who enroll in data science courses. We hope that by creating this website, users who are underrepresented in the field of data science can learn more about data science and see what data science can do for them. This will hopefully inspire individuals to study the field more extensively to close those gaps.</p>
    <h4>Make data science less intimidating</h4>

    	<img class = "profile-pic" src = "pictures/zoe_200.jpg" alt = "Zoe">
        <p  class = "grid-paragraph">My name is Zoe and I'm a student at the High School of Fashion Industries. I will be graduating in 2020. I've done basic coding on and off since sixth grade but didn't seriously get into it until sophomore year of high school when I became a Brown Scholar at the American Museum of Natural History in the BridgeUP: STEM program. My current career goal is to work with or at SONY in either Music, Photo or Interactive Entertainment. I would like users to know that coding is not as hard as it sounds. Personally, the hardest part about coding is knowing why your code does or doesn't work. Just take notes and pseudocode, and be patient with yourself. You Got This!</p>

        <img class = "profile-pic" src = "pictures/maya_200.jpg" alt = "Maya">
        <p  class = "grid-paragraph">Hi! I’m Maya, a high-school student (Class of 2022) in NYC. I have been coding for a few years, and had learned some Java and Swift before becoming a Brown Scholars, where I learned Git, HTML, and CSS, along with important data science concepts in Python. I'm not sure what my career goals are but I would like to go into History or Medicine, specifically Neurology, and hopefully incorporate Computer Science into my profession. Coding may seem daunting at first, but it’s a lot of fun! Seeing the end result after working through errors is really satisfying and the range of applications for computer programming is incredible. I'd definitely encourage any high-school student to try it out!</p>

        <p class = "grid-paragraph">Hi, I'm Selale, I am a high school student and will graduate in 2020. I created the practice page for this website. I took a Computer Science class in 9th grade and learned the basics of Python. I then learned more Python, as well as HTML and CSS, as a Brown Scholar in the BridgeUP: STEM Program. My career goals are to work in healthcare or do research. I want users to know that you’re not going to be an expert from the start. Errors are almost expected, and being able to learn from error messages will help you improve.</p>

        <img class = "profile-pic" src = "pictures/aminata_200.jpg" alt = "Aminata">
        <p class = "grid-paragraph">Hi, my name is Aminata Gadji. I am a high school student (Class of 2019). My first encounter with any kind of coding was when I became a Brown Scholar. It was extremely challenging at first, but with exposure and Google I was able to learn a lot. I am pursuing a career in Nursing and plan to one day found an organization that provides underserved women all over the world with adequate health care and attention. My overarching goal in life is to create an impact in the world and that is why I am studying code. Coding, like any other language allows you to communicate. My tip for users is to treat coding like learning a new language - the more you interact with it the easier it becomes. Practice gives you confidence, so keep typing. Hope you enjoy the site!</p>

      	<h4>Stephanie</h4>
        <img class = "profile-pic" src = "pictures/stephanie_200.jpg" alt = "Stephanie">
        <p class = "grid-paragraph">My name is Stephanie and I started coding in summer 2018. As a Brown Scholar, coding was something new for me. I didn’t know how it worked or what it worked for. It was really hard for me to learn all these new things like the functions, libraries, lists, etc. I honestly thought I wasn’t going to be able to understand all these steps. Now, I’ve been coding for about two years or more. One of my career goals is to learn more about Business so I am able to open my own company. I learned so much about coding and I learned how to work with Python as a Brown Scholar. If you've never tried coding then you should. Even though you will go through so many challenges, it is still fun and exciting seeing your code work.</p>

        <img class = "profile-pic" src = "pictures/yari_200.jpg" alt = "Yarianny">
        <p  class = "grid-paragraph">Hi, I'm Yarianny, but it is easier to call me Yari :3. I'm a High School student and started coding at school using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, as a Brown Scholar I have been coding for two years with four types of languages, including Python. My goals include a career that combines Computer Science with Medicine. I want a job in which I can be pleased to go *_early_* in the morning and work with a smiling face every day. What I want the users to know about me is that basically, I'm like them. I'm a lazy student who wants to reach my dreams, but it doesn't matter how lazy we are (yes we are), we need to go out of our comfort zone and meet new people, new places and new opportunities. Like I did, you probably will discover a lot of new things, and one of those new things can be part of your future like Computer Science was for me.</p>
