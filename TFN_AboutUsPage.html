  <h3>Who We Are: </h3>
    <h4>Six teenage girls who wanted to create a website!</h4>
    <p>Hi there, welcome to our website! Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. So...who are we? Well, we're titanic(float)None (A python joke you will come to understand one day). We're a group of Brown Scholars interns at the American Museum of Natural History who are looking to teach teenagers, like ourselves, about data science.</p>
  <h3>Why Data Science?</h3>
  	<h4>Data Science + Science research = Computational Science</h4>
  		<p></p>
  <h3>Missions and Goals:</h3>
    <h4>Make data science more inclusive</h4>
    	<p> From web development to user experience design the tecnological world is not where it needs to be in terms of inclusiveness and diversity. 35.3% of female students take data science courses compared to 62.8% of male students. Also people of minority groups are the lowest percentage of students who enroll in data sceince courses. We hope by creating this website, users who are underrepresneted in the feild of data scince can learn more about data scinece and see what data science can do for them. This will hopfully inspire individual to study the field more extensivly close those gaps. </p>
    <h4>Make data science less intimidating</h4>
    	<p>Countraty to pouplar belief data scinece is very simple. Very much like how when we come across somthing new we explore it. Data scinece is similar to that, nut you are just doing that "exploring" in the computer. By using this wedsite you will notice that data scinece can be applied to any thing that has data. Data scinece is a just a new way to learn about the world. Its more universal then people believe it to be. Its a new way to do something we have always done. It's a new way to explore the data around you.</p>

I've done basic coding on and off since sixth grade, but didn't seriously get into it until sophomore year of high school when I began a class at the American Museum of Natural History in the BridgeUp: STEM Program. My current career goal is to work with or at SONY in either Music, Photo or Interactive Entertainment. I would like users to know that coding is not as hard as it sounds. Personally,the hardest part about coding is knowing why your code does or doesn't work.Just take notes and psudocode, and be patient with yourself.You Got This!</p>

      <p class = "paragraph">Hi! I’m Maya, a high-school student (Class of 2022) in NYC.I have been coding for a few years, and had learned some concepts in Java and Swift before coming to Brown Scholars, where I learned Git, HTML, and CSS, in addition to learning important data science concepts using the Pandas library in Python.I am not sure what my career goals are, but I would like to go into history or medicine, specifically neurology or psychology, and hopefully find a way to incorporate computer science into my profession.Coding may seem daunting at first, but it’s a lot of fun! Seeing the end result after working through errors is really satisfying and the range of applications for computer programming is incredible. I would definitely encourage any high-school student to try it out!</p>

      <p class = "paragraph">Hi, I'm Yarianny, but it is easier to call me Yari :3, I'm a High School Student like you guys.My background on coding starts at school learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I'm still working on with JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.I have been coding for two years with four types of languages.My career goals are kind of simple; I want a career that combines computer science with medicine. I want a job in which I can be pleased to go *_early_* in the morning and work with a smiling face every day.I want the users to know about me that basically, I'm like them. I'm a lazy student who wants to reach my dream, but it doesn't matter how lazy we're (yes we're). We need to go out of our comfort zone and meet new people, new places and new opportunities like I did, you probably will discover a lot of new things, and one of those new things can be part of your future like for me was computer science</p>

      <p class = "paragraph">I started coding in the program BridgeUp Stem year 1, during the summer. Coding was something new for me, I didn’t know how it worked or what it worked for. It was really hard for me to learn all these new stuff like the functions, libraries, list, etc. I honestly thought I wasn’t going to be able to understand all these steps. I’ve been coding for about half a year or more. One of my career goals is to learn more about business so I could be able open my own company. I learned so much about coding and I learned how to work with Python. If you never tried coding then you should, even though you go through so many challenges is still fun and exciting seeing your code work.</p>

      <p class = "paragraph">Hi, I'm Selale, I am a high school student and will graduate in 2020. I created the practice page for this website. I took a computer science class in 9th grade and learned the basics of Python, and then learned more Python, as well as HTML and CSS, through the first and second years of the BridgeUp: STEM Program. My career goals are to work in healthcare or do research. I want users to know that you’re not going to be an expert from the start. Errors are almost expected, and being able to learn from error messages will help you improve.</p>
