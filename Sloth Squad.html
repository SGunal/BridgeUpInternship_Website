		<h3>Back to the FutuRe: Spatiotemporal Modeling of Sloths (Bradypus)</h3>

		<p>Where do sloths live and why? Sloths inhabit the forests of Central and South America, where there is a warm climate and a wide variety of food. The team conducted research on three species of sloths: Bradypus tridactylus, Bradypus variegatus, and Bradypus torquatus. Occurrence points and environmental data were collected to visualize present sloth ranges. This data was then used to create a machine learning model, which allowed for the mapping of sloth habitats in the present, past, and future (in the year 2070). Our projections into the future and past showed a range of responses from each species.</p>

	<h3>Some challenges we encountered:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A challenge is that sloths are live creatures and migrate, thus plotting them was fairly difficult.</li>
		<li>The data was from a public database and though the team had hoped the data points (longitude and latitude) were accurate, there was room for error.</li>
		<li>The team worked with fairly large databases and ran the code for a while, so code with errors was not fun.</li>
	</ul>
