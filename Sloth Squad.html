	<h1>Sloth Squad</h1>
	<p>The Sloth Squad group was working on sloths, sloths that are in South America. Their project is about mapping the sloths' population. Based on their range they had to used rosters. Using their results they wanted to do a machine where they can predict where the sloths could live by using the information of where they had lived in the past. Basically, a machine to predict the future about sloths and other things, which is important because you are able to predict where these lovely animals(sloths) could live in the future. This group got their data from a public repository, a scientist tourist where anybody can go.</p>
	<h3>Language used:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>R</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A challenge is that sloths are live creatures and migrate, thus plotting them was fairly difficult.</li>
		<li>They were using data from a public database and though they hoped the data points(longitude and latitude) are accurate, there was room for error.</li>
		<li>They worked with fairly large databases, and ran the code for a while, so code with errors was not fun.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Final results/Graphs:</h3>
