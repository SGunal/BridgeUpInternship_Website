	<p>This group was working on sloths that are in South America. Their project was about mapping the sloths' population. Based on their range they had to used rosters. Using their results they wanted to do a machine learning algorithm to predict where the sloths could live by using the information of where they had lived in the past. Basically, a machine learning algorithm to predict the future about sloths, which is important because it helps predict where these "lovely" animals (the sloths) could live in the future. This group got their data from a public repository, a scientist tourist where anybody can go.</p>

	<h3>Some challenges they encountered:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A challenge is that sloths are live creatures and migrate, thus plotting them was fairly difficult.</li>
		<li>The data was from a public database and though the team had hoped the data points (longitude and latitude) were accurate, there was room for error.</li>
		<li>The team worked with fairly large databases and ran the code for a while, so code with errors was not fun.</li>
	</ul>
