<h3>Deep Sea(quencing) Anemone Mitogenomes: Understanding Evolutionary Relationships</h3>

<p>Using Biopython and Phylip, we assembled a phylogeny — a family tree — of nine anemones. These deep-sea dwellers are very difficult to study, as they can live thousands of meters underwater. We recently received sequence data from a handful of new species and have assembled and analyzed these genomes in the greater context of the cnidarian family tree. In particular, we examined the placement of a peculiar organism, Relicanthus, within our anemone group, and found that it is an outlier among known anemone species.</p>

	<h3>Some challenges we encountered:</h3>
 <ul>
	<li>Something challenging was creating new functions. They had to make sure they understood the concept before being able to make the function.</li>
	<li>Understanding the science.</li>
	<li>Another challenge was distance matrix, they had to take two sequences and used the Hammon distance. Had to find the distance in percentages in two sequences.
