<p> This group's main focus was on corals. Their goal was to create a phylogenetic tree of different species of black coral based on the mitochondrial DNA they were analyzing. In other words, a family tree to show the relationship between the corals. They got their data from a lab, which took samples of mitochondrial DNA from different expeditions and sequenced it. An assembly they were given was two or more sequences, where they had to find where they overlapped and connect them at those places. At the beginning they did data cleaning to check the codons, check for dashes, and to detect stop codons. They were given 6 different sequences, had to compare them and find the differences between each of the six sequences. Along the process, functions were also used. They used a function to change an amino acid sequence into the DNA sequence. They also edited distance by seeing how many bases they had to change to make one sequence like another (adding, deleting, substitutions). </p>

	<h3>Some challenges they encountered:</h3>
 <ul>
	<li>Something challenging was creating new functions. They had to make sure they understood the concept before being able to make the function.</li>
	<li>Understanding the science.</li>
	<li>Another challenge was distance matrix, they had to take two sequences and used the Hammon distance. Had to find the distance in percentages in two sequences.
